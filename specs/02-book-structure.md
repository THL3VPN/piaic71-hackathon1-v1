# Feature: Book Structure (4 Modules)

## Requirements
- Book content lives only in `/book/docs`.
- Use autogenerated sidebar for now.
- Create module folders + overview pages:
  1) ROS 2
  2) Gazebo & Unity
  3) NVIDIA Isaac
  4) Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
- Create course-wide pages:
  - Why Physical AI Matters
  - Learning Outcomes
  - Weekly Breakdown
  - Assessments
  - Hardware Requirements

## Acceptance Criteria
- Pages render locally and on GitHub Pages.
- URLs are stable and predictable (folder/file names are deterministic).
- No backend dependency required to read the book.
